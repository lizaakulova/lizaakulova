### Hi there, I’m Liza! :sparkles:🎵

I’m a music student at an institute where I spend most of my time studying theory, practicing instruments, and exploring the rich world of sound. When I’m not immersed in music, I love channeling my creativity into software development projects—especially those that help musicians and music enthusiasts. 🎧🎶

**What I’m Into**  
- 🎹 **Music & Tech Fusion**: Combining my musical background with technology to create tools that empower musicians and enrich the creative process.  
- 🤖 **AI for Creativity**: Exploring machine learning and AI to inspire new approaches in composition, arrangement, and sound design.  
- 💻 **Web Design & Front-End Development**: Crafting intuitive, visually appealing sites and interfaces that deliver a great user experience.

**Projects & Areas of Focus**  
- 🎼 Developing simple, user-friendly applications for music learners.  
- 🔮 Experimenting with AI-driven music recommendation systems.  
- 🎨 Building clean, modern web interfaces that balance style and usability.

**My Goals**  
- 🌐 Bridge the gap between art and science by integrating software development, design, and music.  
- 🧠 Learn more about machine learning frameworks and techniques, applying them to creative projects.  
- 🤝 Contribute to open-source communities, share knowledge, and collaborate on tools that empower musicians and developers alike.

Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or want to collaborate on projects that blend music, code, and innovation! 🚀
